## Introduction
Aliens have challenged the Earth to a football match. We must put together our top 11 to save the planet. I was assigned to compile the data for 200+ football players and present the anaysis in the form of an interactive dashboard.
For this purpose, I extracted over 48,000 rows of data from _footballtransfers.com_. The raw data was then cleaned in RStudio to transfer them into valuable insights. Next step was to visualise these insights. I then made a power BI dashboard, which would assist
the selection committe to make the right decisions.
